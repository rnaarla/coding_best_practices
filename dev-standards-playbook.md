- [ ] **Branch Protection** ‚Äì Enforce passing CI, review approvals, and status checks.  
- [ ] **Issue & PR Templates** ‚Äì Standardize bug reports, feature requests, and PR description.  
- [ ] **Dependabot / Renovate** ‚Äì Auto-bump dependencies; group by ecosystem.  

### GitHub Actions Examples

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` ‚Äì Lint ‚Üí Unit Tests ‚Üí Coverage Report ‚Üí Security Scan.  
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` ‚Äì On tag: build artifacts, publish to registry, generate GitHub Release.  
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` ‚Äì On merge to `main`: deploy to staging/production via Terraform or Helm.

## üîå Editor & IDE Integration

### Dev Container & Local Environment

- [ ] **.devcontainer.json** ‚Äì VS Code devcontainer with Docker Compose for full-stack environment.  
- [ ] **Docker Compose** ‚Äì `docker-compose.yml` for local dependencies (DB, cache, message broker).  
- [ ] **Pre-commit Hooks** ‚Äì Husky or pre-commit to run linters, formatters, and tests on `git commit`.  
- [ ] **Editor Extensions** ‚Äì Recommend settings for YAML, Docker, Terraform, OpenAPI, and Copilot Chat.

## üõ°Ô∏è Quality & Governance Hooks

### Pre-commit & Validation

- [ ] **Lint-Staged** ‚Äì Run ESLint, Black, clang-format on staged files.  
- [ ] **commitlint** ‚Äì Enforce Conventional Commits in PR titles and commit messages.  
- [ ] **Secret Scanning** ‚Äì GitHub‚Äôs secret scanning and local checks (GitLeaks).  

### Copilot-Specific Config

- [ ] **.github/copilot.yml** ‚Äì Define workspace settings, prompt snippets, and file-level annotations (e.g. `// copilot: disable`).  
- [ ] **Prompt Guidelines** ‚Äì Place `CODE_TEMPLATES.md` in `/tools/` with boilerplate snippets for common services, handlers, and tests.  
- [ ] **AI Review Workflow** ‚Äì Automate a step in CI to validate AI-generated code with linters, tests, and custom ‚ÄúAI quality‚Äù checks.

## üìà Telemetry & Feedback

- [ ] **Usage Metrics** ‚Äì Integrate Copilot usage telemetry (opt-in) to track suggestion acceptance and customize prompt libraries.  
- [ ] **Error Reporting** ‚Äì Capture exceptions from generated code via Sentry or similar, close the feedback loop into prompt refinements.
