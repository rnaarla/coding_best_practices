# 🛠 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles
## ✅ Code Analysis Checklist
- [ ] **Encapsulation** – Ensure data hiding & controlled access.
- [ ] **Inheritance** – Favor composition over inheritance to reduce coupling.
- [ ] **Polymorphism** – Use dynamic dispatch instead of if-else chains.
- [ ] **Abstraction** – Minimize the exposure of implementation details.
- [ ] **Dependency Injection** – Remove tight coupling between objects.

## 🔧 Refactoring Guidelines
- Convert static utility methods into object-oriented classes.
- Use interface-based programming to enable loose coupling.
- Extract reusable logic into helper methods & modular classes.

# 🏆 Software Engineering Best Practices
## ✅ Principles
- **Separation of Concerns (SoC)** – Modularize responsibilities.
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** – Keep classes focused.
- **Open-Closed Principle (OCP)** – Allow extensions without modification.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)** – Subtypes should replace base types seamlessly.
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)** – Avoid forcing classes to implement unused methods.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** – Depend on abstractions, not concretions.
- **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)** – Minimize redundancy.
- **Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS)** – Prefer simplicity over complexity.
- **You Ain't Gonna Need It (YAGNI)** – Avoid overengineering.
